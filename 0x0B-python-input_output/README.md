# Python Input/Output

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various input/output operations,
including file handling and JSON serialization/deserialization.

## Files Overview

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [0-read_file.py](./0-read_file.py) | Reads a text file and prints its content to stdout. |
| [1-write_file.py](./1-write_file.py) | Writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written. |
| [2-append_write.py](./2-append_write.py) | Appends a string to the end of a text file and returns the number of characters added. |
| [3-to_json_string.py](./3-to_json_string.py) | Returns the JSON representation of an object (string). |
| [4-from_json_string.py](./4-from_json_string.py) | Returns an object represented by a JSON string. |
| [5-save_to_json_file.py](./5-save_to_json_file.py) | Writes an object to a JSON file. |
| [6-load_from_json_file.py](./6-load_from_json_file.py) | Loads an object from a JSON file. |
| [7-add_item.py](./7-add_item.py) | Adds arguments to a Python list and saves them to a JSON file. |
| [8-class_to_json.py](./8-class_to_json.py) | Returns a dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object. |
| [9-student.py](./9-student.py) | Defines a `Student` class with methods for JSON serialization. |
| [10-student.py](./10-student.py) | Extends `Student` class with filtering for JSON serialization. |
| [11-student.py](./11-student.py) | Extends `Student` class with a method for reloading from JSON. |
| [12-pascal_triangle.py](./12-pascal_triangle.py) | Generates Pascal's triangle as a list of lists of integers. |

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, navigate to the repository directory in your terminal and execute the desired script using Python:

```bash
./script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you want to execute.

##Features
All scripts use Python 3.8.5 and follow PEP8 guidelines.
Each script demonstrates a specific input/output operation or JSON manipulation technique.
The with statement is consistently used for file handling to ensure proper resource management.
No external modules are imported for the main functionalities, ensuring minimal dependencies.
